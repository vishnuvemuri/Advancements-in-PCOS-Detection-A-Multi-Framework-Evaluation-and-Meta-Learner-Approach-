# PCOS-Detection
PCOS Detection using DeepLearning

Overview
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age. Early and accurate detection of PCOS is crucial for effective management and treatment. This project explores advancements in PCOS detection by employing a multi-framework evaluation and a meta-learner approach. By leveraging various machine learning models and combining their strengths, this project aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of PCOS diagnosis.

Features
Multi-Framework Evaluation: Implements and evaluates multiple machine learning frameworks to identify the best-performing models.
Meta-Learner Approach: Combines the outputs of different models using a meta-learner for improved prediction accuracy.
Comprehensive Data Analysis: Includes data preprocessing, feature selection, and exploratory data analysis.
Model Training and Evaluation: Provides scripts for training individual models and the meta-learner, along with performance evaluation metrics.
Visualization Tools: Offers tools for visualizing data distributions, feature importance, and model performance.
User-Friendly Interface: Features an easy-to-use interface for running experiments and analyzing results.
